Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this application was to design and build a weight tracking app for users to input a goal weight and track daily weight changes. The user needed to be able to add an account and save their details for username and password and receive text notifications to update them on their progress. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app needed to have screens to login and register a user, it also needed a screen to input the daily weight and view all the previous inputed weights. It also needs a screen to change their password and set up notifications. My app had a very minimal UI design to allow users to focus on the functionality and not worry about excess features they didnt need and I feel I was successful in that, if I could have users test my application I think they would find it very user friendly.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I tried to design this application focusing on the views first and then work backwards with the applied code. I tried to wireframe the front end thinking about how the functionality of the buttons on the views would connect to the database. I think in the future I would want to spent more time on planning the code earlier in the design process instead of trying to work backwards from the views.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ran debugging inside Android Studio multiple times in the process to test the functionality of the app and use the emulator inside the editor. Testing is very important especially in mobile development because you may not be able to get the build onto a phone and using the emulator lets you test early and often.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate during this build to use multiple testing procedures as this was my first mobile project I didn't know what to look out for in terms of potential issues so I read from other developers on potential issues to look out for and tested inside and out of Android studio in my other IDE to make sure any bugs weren't missed.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think being able to connect my login page to the database was particularly succesful because this is a crucial part of deploying a real world application and being able to store user details makes the application viable for public use.
